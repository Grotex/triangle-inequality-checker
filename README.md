[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/costika1234/triangle-inequality-checker.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/costika1234/triangle-inequality-checker)

# triangle-inequality-checker

# Dependencies

The **triangle-inequality-checker** can be built on UNIX platforms using **g++/clang++** and requires only the [exprtk](https://github.com/ArashPartow/exprtk) submodule to be imported (see **Makefile**).

# How to use?

Build the project via the **make** command and then run it using **./bin/check_triangle_inequality**. The input to the program can be entered in the **inequality.txt** on the first line. Additionally, inequality constraints can be added on subsequent lines to check the original inequality on a restricted space of values. After entering a new input, simply re-run the program executable to check the validity of the provided inequality.
